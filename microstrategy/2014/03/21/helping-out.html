<p>The latest version of MicroStrategy comes with an out of the box link to vendor-hosted help pages. These are probably better, and more extensive, than anything you’re going to do in-house.</p>

<p>However well-written they are though, they’re not always going to be a perfect fit, for your users, or your particular implementation. Perhaps you want to encourage people not to save copies of reports, but rather save personal prompt answers. Perhaps you’ve got some guidance and documentation about the model of the business you’ve created in the tool. Regardless, It would be good to be able to link to that documentation directly in the front end of the tool, as well as via a separate website. (I hope you’re not distributing Word documents, or god forbid, Powerpoint presentations, as documentation. It <strong>is</strong> the 21st Century you know!)</p>

<p>Now, there is an example in the excellent SDK documentation that details how to customise the MicroStrategy help files, but often custom documentation needs to sit alongside the standard help files.</p>
