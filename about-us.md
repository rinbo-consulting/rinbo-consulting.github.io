Really, it can be summed up with one word; *change*.

Over the past decade and a half, I've gained experience of most types of change that can happen in a Business Intelligence. Specifically:

* Migrating a database from one platform to another
* Migrating a reporting front end from one platform to another
* Migrating both at the same type
* Implementing a new physical schema (DB)
* Implementing a new logical schema (MicroStrategy)
* Rationalising a long-standing reporting environment
* Implementing a greenfield BI system, from initial user engagement to supporting the business after go-live
* Working with development teams, both small and large, to optimise their development process
* Extensive customisation using MicroStrategy's SDK, bending the product to fit unusual requirements
* Mentoring and advising developers, both from a technical perspective, and how to engage with the business
